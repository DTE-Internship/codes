            <p style="text-align: justify;">D’Headstone Cheers is committed to every child, we provide every need for all children in
              our care who still reside with his/her parents or in an orphanage. There are very many essential things a
              child needs to grow and develop into a confident teenager, and these are what we deliver in top notch
              quality.</p>

          </div>
          <h1 class="text-cursive mb-4"> A. QUALITY EDUCATION</h1>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Education is the intellectual enlightenment from ignorance to knowledge. The goal of education is the
            advancement of knowledge and the dissemination of truth- John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Every child has the
            right to quality education, no child should be left roaming the streets for the purpose of daily bread.
            Quality education provides foundation for equity in the society. We at DHC understand the very
            importance of quality education and we try our best possible to empower children through our initiatives.
            Our key Strategies to providing or fostering quality education-</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">Back to school- </h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">This initiative is committed to the provision of materials needed for quality
         education. Education should not just be available but must be enjoyable by every child, but this
         cannot be achieved except there are adequate and relevant teaching and learning materials like
         notebooks, text books and other reading materials, comfortable school bags, water bottles.
         Education can be enjoyable when all these materials are made available, but in the society were
         poverty is the norm for every 9 families in 10, academic sponsorship is needed to give every child
         the opportunity to attend a school and learn.</p>

         <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">School kits- </h3>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">Books, comfortable school bags, lunch boxes, water bottles, mathematical
         sets, pens, pencils, and even school uniforms are all important kits to achieve a smooth
         sail for a child in his/her academics. As much as school bags are overlooked, they are
         essential for the protection and carriage of books and other writing materials to and from
         school, they also affect the posture of a child negatively if not well managed and
         monitored, exposing the child to bone deformities, the child begins to slouch and this can
        also cause pain. D’Headstone cheers is sold out to giving children a good shot at quality
        education with quality tools and kits, making education fun and enjoyable.</p>

        <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">Academic sponsorship-</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">he primary goal of sponsorship is to help provide children with
          their best chance for success. And since Education is the intellectual enlightenment from
          ignorance to knowledge, a number of parents lack the financial capability to provide this
          basic need for their children. D’Headstone Cheers! Is aimed at making sure to
          eradicate illiteracy as well as giving better opportunities to everybody. There are many
          ways a we can achieve these goals: donations (cash and equipment), scholarships, and
          so on. Regardless of the methodology, the aim is always to improve and promote
          universal access to education.</p>

          <h1 class="text-cursive mb-4"> B. MEDICAL SERVICES (CHILD HEALTH)</h1>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Child health care is defined as the medical services that are provided by the medical health professionals
            to the children having diseases or infections. childs health includes physical, mental and social well-
            being. Most parents know the basics of keeping children healthy, like offering them healthy foods, making
            sure they get enough sleep and exercise and insuring their safety, but many parents cannot afford to do
            so.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">Free medical checkups and support for children</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Free medical checkups is one of the many strategies we adopt to touching lives at D’Headstone
          <font style="color:red;"> Cheers!</font>. We visit communities and offer free medical services to the children in need of it. This is
          done by the Medical professionals Volunteering at the NGO. These professionals also proffer
          solutions to any problem found in the health of a child, free consultation and treatment for minor
          sicknesses. Free medical supplies are also given out.</p>

          <h1 class="text-cursive mb-4">C. PARTNERSHIPS WITH Orphanages, Hospices and Foundations.</h1>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">D’Headstone <font style="color:red;"> Cheers!</font> also partners with other NGOs to meet the need of other children who we could
            not reach through our very many platforms. We do this monetarily or by sending basic needs to the
            orphanages or hospices. We also sponsor campaigns for advocacy and volunteer to help in ways that
            will further improve the lives of the children. This is done so as to broaden the horizon of the NGO
            and not just restrict us to the children and other persons we can easily reach and administer help to.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-cursive mb-4">D.HAPPY FEET! …Every child deserves to be Happy.</h1>

              together in love, showing them the love of Christ at Christmas, and in turn making the society a better
              place.
              <br>
              There has been issues of disrupted families and distorted homes, which is detrimental to the quality of
              growth and development of children into responsible adulthood and in turn affect the society negatively.

              teaching and educating them on how family members should endeavor to maintain unity and harmony in
              their homes, resolve conflicts before they rare their ugly heads, the importance of education for the
              children, and also equally know that all problems in the family cannot be totally eradicated but they should
              be aware that the longer they are together the better for them. We would also implore the help of social
              service workers to provide assistance and advocacy to improve social and psychological functioning of
              children and their families. carrying out therapeutic techniques to help beef up the relationship between
              parents and their children be it a child, adolescent or youth. We will also continue to pay close attention to
