            <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">LIFE COACH/ GUARD (Adolescent)</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Teen age is quite a critical time where youngsters become vulnerable to external pressures and
              become influenced by the corrupt world. This critical stage is called the Adolescence, their bodies begin
              to produce hormones which if not managed well can lead them to making wrong decisions about
              sexuality, career, and other critical choices. Adolescence period is a transitional period in the
              development of critical thinking and a time of increased decision making. They then require major,
              guidance and counselling, and we also help them acquire appropriate academic, social, psychological
              and moral development, close watch and monitoring so as to protect and positively influence them into
              making the right decisions and to take the right steps into succeeding and having a great future. DHC
              LIFE COACH/ GUARD is committed to having a close watch on these not so little ones.</p>

            <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">INITIATIVES</h3>
          </div>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Quality Education (Individual Sponsorship).</li>
              <li>Gender Equality (Girl-Child and Boy-Child Empowerment).</li>
              <li>Wellbeing Platforms.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">These initiatives are all part of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations, this being said is
            what we seek to achieve with the LIFE COACH/GUARD initiative.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">QUALITY EDUCATION. (INDIVIDUAL SPONSORSHIP)</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Educational sponsorship</font> is when an organization invests in education-related programs, making sure
          to eradicate illiteracy as well as giving better opportunities to everybody. This can be achieved in several
          ways, through donations (cash and equipment), scholarships, and so on. The major aim being to improve
          and promote universal access to education. We partner with corporations who would be willing to sponsor
          students’ tuition fees all around the world. allocate direct scholarships for worthy and low-income
          students. Nevertheless, there are times when a student can win a scholarship through a contest, probably
          with the award going to the student who come up with the most innovative idea on how to eradicate
          mosquitoes, for example – for people applying for medical courses.</p>

         <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">GENDER EQUALITY (GIRL-CHILD AND BOY-CHILD EMPOWERMENT)</h3>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">Gender equality means that women and men and girls and boys enjoy the same rights, resources,
          opportunities and protections. Investments in gender equality contribute to lifelong positive outcomes for
          children and their communities and yield considerable inter-generational payoffs, as children’s rights and
          well-being often depend on the rights and well-being of women.
          <font style="font-weight: bold;">Gender equality,</font> also known as  <font style="font-weight: bold;">sexual equality</font> or  <font style="font-weight: bold;">equality of the sexes</font>, is the state of equal ease of
          access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and
          decision-making; and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations and needs equally, regardless of
          gender.
          <br>
          <font style="font-weight: bold;">Empowerment</font> can be said to be the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in
          controlling one’s life and claiming one’s rights.</p>

        <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">GIRL-CHILD EMPOWERMENT</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Conceptually, one is considered a ‘girl-child’ if she is a biological female offspring aged 18 years or less
          (ICMNCH, 2013), normally under the care of adults.
          Empowering females, is majorly to help them make decisions on their own, to educate, encourage and
          teach them how to be independent and secure. According to Tuyizere (2007), education is an essential
          tool for achieving the goals of equality, peace and development, and it is a useful tool for addressing the
          religious and cultural impediments that deny girls access to education. In her view. Non-discriminatory
          education benefits both boys and girls. And ultimately contributes to the establishment of more equal
          relationships between men and women. That is why she concludes that equal access to, and attainment
          of, educational qualifications is necessary if more women and girls are to become agents of change. The
          
          6
          education of a girl-child is a vital factor in dealing with the root causes of poverty and underdevelopment
          (Ahunna 2013).</p>

          <h3 class="text-cursive mb-4">BOY-CHILD EMPOWERMENT</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The simplest way to identify past achievements in child development is to observe the behavior patterns
            of the current adult population. The increase in cases of substance abuse amongst the youth, the rise of
            crime levels, the sharp increase in fraudulent acts “Yahoo yahoo” attributed to online thievery, the
            extortion of money from innocent Nigerian citizens and the rise in rape of young helpless girls, the
            increase in the number of absent fathers is a reflection of bleeding Nigerian society.
